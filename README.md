Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor-El, moments before Krypton's destruction…</br>

solar invulnerability, flight…</br>

● Images: a set of images of the superhero.</br>

"Functional requirements"</br>
● Create, edit and remove a superhero</br>
● When creating / editing we want to be able to assign and remove images from a
superhero</br>
● List all the superheros, seeing only one image for each and it’s nickname, with
pagination, showing 5 items at once</br>
● See the details of one particular superhero with all it’s information and images</br>
